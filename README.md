**3D POINT CLOUD CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING**

our project is reconstruction of 2d to 3d images.In this project we are using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) Algorithm .The activity of CNN is based on the our project is reconstruction of 2d to 3d images.in this project we are using convolutional neural network(cnn) algorithm .the activity of cnn is based on the input given in dots
it automatically convert the dots  or patterns into the
respected image what we have given in a 2d format .
therefore it produces the image properly and we can visualize
there.

these are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases.
these neurons receives numerous inputs and then takes a pattern
from that and provide an output.




step 1: Firstly extract the depth to the
max level.
step 2:Then the input of two 2D images were stitched 
together and the centralised of the image loaction is fixed.
Now we know the maximum depth field og the given images.

step 3: Next we need to find the length and width of the object (i.e) 
depth fused 

step 4:After that we need to shape the image by using 
depth smoothing.

step 5: After shaping the image and we need to render it So for that
we need to fix an object in the space and then that object is 
rotated till 360 degree and it shown each and every angle  and
then it is shown in viewable format.
